# Shop
This was the shop plugin designed to handle payment procedures from my Forums software i created. Whilst i wont be open sourcing the forums i am open sourcing this part so you can get an understanding of how our payments were sent from the server 

# Some questions you may have
- Why did you open source this?
  - This was open sourced due to my mental health being destroyed by the server i worked at. They continued to blame me for my mental health saying that it was affecting them more than it was affecting me and i blew it off originally. Next minute they remove me from the project and say that it's just while they try to sort some shit out with a skid but honestly they were lying to me haha. Whilst my mental health is still not in a great state i thought i might aswell open source everything i have that i made myself. I wont be releasing any code that was forked as you could quite easily get the original versions to what was made. Anyway i hope my long overdue quit to the community pleases you all and i hope to never come back lmao
